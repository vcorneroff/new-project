# The Shiny New Project

1. Clone the repository using the command: `git clone <repo-link>`
2. Create a branch for your changes: `git checkout -b YOUR_BRANCH_NAME`  
   For example: `git checkout -b PROM-42164_repo_init`
3. Make your code great again.
4. If you created new files, add them: `git add your_new_file.go`
5. Commit your changes to the local repository: `git commit -m "Describe what you've done"`
6. Check what was committed (or changed) using: `git diff`
7. If everything looks correct, push your changes to the remote repository and create a merge request:  
   `git push --set-upstream origin YOUR_BRANCH_NAME`
8. After the push is done, Git will provide a repo link. Open it and check changes.
